# Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews Data Exploration
## by Lama AlDaej


## Motivation
This is my first project in Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. This project analyzes the dataset of Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews/version/1) to prove how customer reviews give people power by answering the following questions:
1. Does the E-commerce website satisfy its customers?
2. What are the best clothing class, department, and division that have the highest rating reviews?
3. What are the differences in the most frequent words of the best and worst rated reviews?
4. What is the most customers’ age range of the company, and how helpful are their reviews?
5. How helpful are the reviews for the other customers?

## Used Libraries
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- WordCloud



## Description of the Repository's Files
- Women E-commerce Clothing Reviews.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code of the cleaning and analyzing the dataset.
- Women E-commerce Clothing Reviews.html is a HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook of the cleaning and analyzing the dataset.
- Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews.csv is a CSV file of the Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews/version/1).

## Summary of the Results of the Analysis
1. The company seems to satisfy its customers since its customers tend to write 5 rating reviews, and 82% of them recommend its products.
2. The best-rated division is ‘General’, the best-rated department is ‘Tops’, and the best-rated clothing class is ‘Dresses’.
3. The best-rated reviews contain many positive words such as ‘flattering’, ‘pretty’, ‘love’, ‘lovely’, and ‘happy’. Whereas the worst-rated reviews contain many negative words such as ‘poor’, ‘uncomfortable’, ‘overpriced’, and ‘small’.
4. The company’s customers are mostly young adults between (20–39) which is expected since they use the internet the most. Also, customers who are in their 39 are most likely to recommend a product and other customers found that the reviews that written by customers in their mid-30s were helpful.
5. Other customers find the low-rated reviews more helpful than the high-rated ones. They also prove that reviews with no text tend to have a high rating; however, other customers don’t find these reviews helpful at all.
